## Technologies Used

### Languages Used
- Python

### Libraries Used
- [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/): Used for colored text output in the console.

## Testing

### Code Testing
- **Manual Testing**: Extensive manual testing was performed to ensure all game features function as intended.
  - Validated that the grid initializes correctly.
  - Ensured random ship placement does not overlap.
  - Verified that hits, misses, and ship counts update correctly.
  - Tested user input validation for coordinate guessing.
  - Checked game over conditions and restart functionality.

### Bugs

#### Fixed Bugs
- **Ship Lengths**: Initially, ships of lengths 3, 2, and 1 were used, causing incorrect ship count reflections. This was fixed by using ships of length 1 only.

#### Unfixed Bugs
- **Code Linter Warnings**: The Python code contains lines that exceed the 79-character limit as specified by PEP 8. Despite refactoring efforts, some lines still exceed this limit. The game functions correctly, but these warnings are acknowledged in the code linter results.
